In this post I'll explain how to deploy a Hakyll blog using CircleCI and AWS CodeDeploy

<!--more-->

TODO: write post

trick: can mostly just talk about circleci instead of going into the mess that is aws config

actually yeah that would rule


use actual build's status badge in post

note: now it's all using terraform for AWS config so I don't need to write up manual steps, lel
